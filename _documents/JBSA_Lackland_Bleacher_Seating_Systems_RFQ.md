ADDENDUM TO 52.212-2 EVALUATION COMMERCIAL ITEMS (Nov 2021) ADDENDUM Addendum to 52.212-2(a): Paragraph (a) is tailored as follows: The following have been deleted: (b) Options has been deleted in its entirety. (b)(iii) Past Performance has been deleted in its entirety. The following have been added or changed: (a) Basis for Award. The Government intends to award one Firm-Fixed-Price contract for this acquisition. Award will be made to technically acceptable Offerors who are deemed responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104 and whose quote conforms to the solicitation requirements. The solicitation requirements include all stated terms, conditions, and all other information required by this quote. Unless specifically identified in your quote, by submission of its quote, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. Failure to meet a requirement may result in a quote being determined ineligible for award. 

This contract will be awarded as Firm Fixed Price (FFP). It is the Government's intent to evaluate quotes and award without interchanges with Offerors. Therefore, the Offeror's initial quotes should contain the Offeror's best terms from a price, and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct interchanges if the Contracting Officer (CO) later determines them to be necessary. 

1. Evaluation Process. The evaluation factor and process to be used is listed below. 1.1. Evaluation Factors. In evaluating quotes, the Government will select the quote that is most advantageous to the Government. To arrive at a decision, only the three lowest quotes will be assessed in accordance with the following evaluation factors for the award "Lowest Price Technically Acceptable". 1.1.1. Technical Evaluation. If the Government receives three (3) of fewer quotes, all quotes will be evaluated for Technical Acceptability. If the Government receives more than three (3) quotes, the Government will only select the three (3) lowest priced quotes and then evaluate them for Technical Acceptability. The Government reserves the right to evaluate additional quotes for technical acceptability if in the Government's best interest. If additional quotes are evaluated for technical acceptability, they will be selected in the order of total evaluated price. (a) Acceptability Ratings. The evaluation factors listed below will be used to evaluate each quote and will receive one of the following ratings: (i) Acceptable - (1) Proposed quote. The proposed quote that clearly meet the characteristics as listed in this RFQ and the SOW. (ii) Unacceptable - (1) Proposed quote. The proposed quote does not meet the characteristics as listed in this RFQ and the SOW. 1.1.2. Price Evaluation. Evaluations will be completed by determining the extended amount for each Line Item Number (CLIN) and the total evaluated price (TEP). The extended amount for each CLIN will be determined by multiplying the unit price by the quantity. An offeror's TEP will be determined by adding the extended amount for all CLINs. The Government may require submission of information other than cost or pricing data to the extent necessary to evaluate price reasonableness. 1.1.2.2. Evaluation of Factors. Offerors are advised that their initial submission should be their best effort. Only technically acceptable quotes, either initially or as a result of interchanges, are eligible for award. If award is made without interchanges, quote revisions will not be permitted. The Government will evaluate the quotes selected above for technical acceptability on an Acceptable/Unacceptable basis. For the technical quote to be rated as "Acceptable", the technical factor must be rated acceptable. If the technical factor is rated "Unacceptable" the overall quote will be rated as "Unacceptable". (A) Interchanges. Under appropriate circumstances, interchanges can be an effective method to improve the Government's evaluation of Offerors' quoted approaches and may reduce acquisition cycle time. Interchanges may be written, email, phone call, etc., or any method which would accurately capture the contemporaneous sharing of information between the Government and the Offerors. Interchanges may also be oral conversations between the Government and the Offerors. (B) Factor # 1 -Submit product descriptions for each item being quoted. The Offeror shall submit product specifications that match the SOW. The standard has been met when: The offeror provides products that fully conform to the product description requirements specified in the SOW. (End of Addendum)

**52.232-1 Payments. (Apr 1984)** 

As prescribed in 32.111(a)(1), insert the following clause, appropriately modified with respect to payment due date in accordance with agency regulations, in solicitations and contracts when a fixed-price supply contract, a fixed-price service contract, or a contract for nonregulated communication services is contemplated: 

Payments (Apr 1984) 

The Government shall pay the Contractor, upon the submission of proper invoices or vouchers, the prices stipulated in this contract for supplies delivered and accepted or services rendered and accepted, less any deductions provided in this contract. Unless otherwise specified in this contract, payment shall be made on partial deliveries accepted by the Government if

 (a) The amount due on the deliveries warrants it; or 

 (b) The Contractor requests it and the amount due on the deliveries is at least $1,000 or 50 percent of the total contract price. 

(End of clause) 

**52.232-25 Prompt Payment. (Jan 2017)** 

Prompt Payment (Jan 2017) 

Notwithstanding any other payment clause in this contract, the Government will make invoice payments under the terms and conditions specified in this clause. The Government considers payment as being made on the day a check is dated or the date of an electronic funds transfer (EFT). Definitions of pertinent terms are set forth in sections 2.101, 32.001, and 32.902 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. All days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise specified. (However, see paragraph (a)(4) of this clause concerning payments due on Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.) 

 (a) Invoice payments

 (1) Due date. 

(i) Except as indicated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (c) of this clause, the due date for making invoice payments by the designated payment office is the later of the following two events: 

 (A) The 30 thday after the designated billing office receives a proper invoice from the Contractor (except as provided in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this clause). 

(B) The 30 thday after Government acceptance of supplies delivered or services performed. For a final invoice, when the payment amount is subject to contract settlement actions, acceptance is deemed to occur on the effective date of the contract settlement. 

(ii) If the designated billing office fails to annotate the invoice with the actual date of receipt at the time of receipt, the invoice payment due date is the 30 thday after the date of the Contractor's invoice, provided the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and there is no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with contract requirements. 

 (2) Certain food products and other payments. 

(i) Due dates on Contractor invoices for meat, meat food products, or fish; perishable agricultural commodities; and dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils are

(A) For meat or meat food products, as defined in section 2(a)(3) of the Packers and Stockyard Act of1921 (7 U.S.C.182(3)), and as further defined in Pub.L.98-181, including any edible fresh or frozen poultry meat, any perishable poultry meat food product, fresh eggs, and any perishable egg product, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7 thday after product delivery. 

(B) For fresh or frozen fish, as defined in section 204(3) of the Fish and Seafood Promotion Act of1986 (16 U.S.C.4003(3)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 7 thday after product delivery. 

(C) For perishable agricultural commodities, as defined in section 1(4) of the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act of1930 (7 U.S.C.499a(4)), as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10 thday after product delivery, unless another date is specified in the contract. 

(D) For dairy products, as defined in section 111(e) of the Dairy Production Stabilization Act of1983 (7 U.S.C.4502(e)), edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils, as close as possible to, but not later than, the 10 thday after the date on which a proper invoice has been received. Liquid milk, cheese, certain processed cheese products, butter, yogurt, ice cream, mayonnaise, salad dressings, and other similar products, fall within this classification. Nothing in the Act limits this classification to refrigerated products. When questions arise regarding the proper classification of a specific product, prevailing industry practices will be followed in specifying a contract payment due date. The burden of proof that a classification of a specific product is, in fact, prevailing industry practice is upon the Contractor making the representation. 

 (ii) If the contract does not require submission of an invoice for payment (e.g., periodic lease payments), the due date will be as specified in the contract. 

(3) Contractor's invoice. The Contractor shall prepare and submit invoices to the designated billing office specified in the contract. A proper invoice must include the items listed in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(x) of this clause. If the invoice does not comply with these requirements, the designated billing office will return it within 7 days after receipt (3 days for meat, meat food products, or fish; 5 days for perishable agricultural commodities, dairy products, edible fats or oils, and food products prepared from edible fats or oils), with the reasons why it is not a proper invoice. The Government will take into account untimely notification when computing any interest penalty owed the Contractor. 

 (i) Name and address of the Contractor. 

 (ii) Invoice date and invoice number. (The Contractor should date invoices as close as possible to the date of the mailing or transmission.) 

 Page 13 of 39 


 (iii) Contract number or other authorization for supplies delivered or services performed (including order number and line item number). 

 (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price, and extended price of supplies delivered or services performed. 

(v) Shipping and payment terms (e.g., shipment number and date of shipment, discount for prompt payment terms). Bill of lading number and weight of shipment will be shown for shipments on Government bills of lading. 

 (vi) Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to be sent (must be the same as that in the contract or in a proper notice of assignment). 

 (vii) Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing address of person to notify in the event of a defective invoice. 

 (viii) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. 

 (ix) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information. 

 (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. 

(B) If EFT banking information is not required to be on the invoice, in order for the invoice to be a proper invoice, the Contractor shall have submitted correct EFT banking information in accordance with the applicable solicitation provision (e.g., 52.232-38, Submission of Electronic Funds Transfer Information with Offer), contract clause (e.g., 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer-System for Award Management, or 52.232-34, Payment by Electronic Funds TransferOther Than System for Award Management), or applicable agency procedures. 

 (C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT. 

 (x) Any other information or documentation required by the contract (e.g., evidence of shipment). 

(4) Interest penalty. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if payment is not made by the due date and the conditions listed in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (a)(4)(iii) of this clause are met, if applicable. However, when the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the designated payment office may make payment on the following working day without incurring a late payment interest penalty. 

 (i) The designated billing office received a proper invoice. 

(ii) The Government processed a receiving report or other Government documentation authorizing payment, and there was no disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with any contract term or condition. 

(iii) In the case of a final invoice for any balance of funds due the Contractor for supplies delivered or services performed, the amount was not subject to further contract settlement actions between the Government and the Contractor. 

(5) Computing penalty amount. The Government will compute the interest penalty in accordance with the Office of Management and Budget prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. 

(i) For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7 thday (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision. If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance. The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities. 

(ii) The prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR1315.10(c) do not require the Government to pay interest penalties if payment delays are due to disagreement between the Government and the Contractor over the payment amount or other issues involving contract compliance, or on amounts temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Government and the Contractor shall resolve claims involving disputes and any interest that may be payable in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes. 

(6) Discounts for prompt payment. The designated payment office will pay an interest penalty automatically, without request from the Contractor, if the Government takes a discount for prompt payment improperly. The Government will calculate the interest penalty in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. 

 (7) Additional interest penalty. 

(i) The designated payment office will pay a penalty amount, calculated in accordance with the prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315 in addition to the interest penalty amount only if

 (A) The Government owes an interest penalty of $1 or more; 

 (B) The designated payment office does not pay the interest penalty within 10 days after the date the invoice amount is paid; and 

(C) The Contractor makes a written demand to the designated payment office for additional penalty payment, in accordance with paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this clause, postmarked not later than 40 days after the invoice amount is paid. 

 (ii) 

(A) The Contractor shall support written demands for additional penalty payments with the following data. The Government will not request any additional data. The Contractor shall

(1) Specifically assert that late payment interest is due under a specific invoice, and request payment of all overdue late payment interest penalty and such additional penalty as may be required; 

 (2) Attach a copy of the invoice on which the unpaid late payment interest is due; and 

 Page 14 of 39 


 (3) State that payment of the principal has been received, including the date of receipt. 

 (B) If there is no postmark or the postmark is illegible

(1) The designated payment office that receives the demand will annotate it with the date of receipt, provided the demand is received on or before the 40th day after payment was made; or 

(2) If the designated payment office fails to make the required annotation, the Government will determine the demand's validity based on the date the Contractor has placed on the demand, provided such date is no later than the 40th day after payment was made. 

(iii) The additional penalty does not apply to payments regulated by other Government regulations (e.g., payments under utility contracts subject to tariffs and regulation). 

(b) Contract financing payment. If this contract provides for contract financing, the Government will make contract financing payments in accordance with the applicable contract financing clause. 

(c) Fast payment procedure due dates. If this contract contains the clause at 52.213-1, Fast Payment Procedure, payments will be made within 15 days after the date of receipt of the invoice. 

(d) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall

 (1) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the

 (i) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); 

 (ii) Affected contract number and delivery order number if applicable; 

 (iii) Affected line item or subline item, if applicable; and 

 (iv) Contractor point of contact. 

 (2) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer.

(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 

(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 

(ii) Examples. 

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 

(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
